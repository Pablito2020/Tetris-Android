## Pull Requests ❤️

Pull requests are, a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following
things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your
contribution.

For example:

> feat(welcome): change settings button color

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> feat(login): change settings button color because the current ones
> make a contrast that isn't easy to read.

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me
the action you have taken to solve it.

### Is it of good quality

  - There are no spelling mistakes
  - It reads well
  - For english language contributions: Has a good score on
    [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) or [Hemingway
    App](https://www.hemingwayapp.com/)
